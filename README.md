# Inertia Live documentation

Inertia Live keeps Inertia pages in sync with [Spatie Event Sourcing](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-event-sourcing) projections. The server declares which projection changes affect which page props; the package broadcasts a small "topic changed" signal and the client reloads only the affected props through the page's own controller.

## How the pieces fit

```
stored event ──► projector ──► ChangeBuffer ──► (after commit) ChangeFlusher ──► Echo/Reverb
  #[LiveTopic]   EmitsLiveChanges   coalesce          sequence + rate limit         private-live.{topic}
                                                                                         │
page props ◄── router.reload({ only }) ◄── debounce ◄── LiveClient (drops stale versions)
```

The socket never carries model data. Policies, hidden attributes and per-user fields keep working because the data still comes from your controller.
